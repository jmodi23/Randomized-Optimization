Welcome to my readme!

LANGUAGE: PYTHON
METHOD: JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS

The code for each respective dataset is written in a separate file, to make it easier to process!
If you have Anaconda Navigator, all relevant libraries are already accessible and ready to use. If not, please take a look at the file labeled "pip-requirements.txt".. 

**To run the code**

The setup:
Each of the three problems are setup in their own .ipynb: MaxKColor, Queens, KnapSack, and the Neural Networks.

Please set up an environment that supports .ipynb files. This could be Google Colab, Jupyter Notebooks, or the Anaconda Navigator environment. Then, on the top, clicks "Cells" > "Run All".

Happy coding!
